# kongnamul

`kongnamul` is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,  
born from a desire to question familiar patterns.

Instead of taking React and modern UI abstractions for granted,  
this project rebuilds a UI library from scratch,  
documenting the design decisions and trade-offs along the way.

## Roadmap

This roadmap is a chronological record of building `kongnamul` from scratch.

Each day includes:
- A design diary explaining the motivation and trade-offs
- A corresponding Git tag or branch representing the code at that point

You can read the design first, then explore the code at that stage.
